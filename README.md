# TensorFlow_MNIST_CNN
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) assignment for Machine Learning course using TensorFlow library in Python on the MNIST dataset

The purpose of this study was to test network structures, and their hyperparameters, for fitting a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A completely crossed experimental design was employed, testing out 3 hyperparameters: initialization, optimization, and normalization. Two initialization methods were considered: He initialization utilizing a fan average and Xavier initialization. Two optimization methods were considered: Adam and Nesterov. Finally, batch normalization was either used or not used. The best configuration was then applied to a deeper CNN to see if the score could be improved. The dataset was MNIST, which consists of a set of 70,000 handwritten digits by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. The models were compared using the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. They were also evaluated based on the time it took to run the models.
